## What is Cassini

Cassini is a software that generates highly accurate topographic maps from [LiDAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar) data and shapefiles vector data. The maps produced by Cassini follow the [International Specification for Orienteering Maps (ISOM)](https://orienteering.sport/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=shareonedrive-download&id=663580750D0C0BCE!50104&dl=1&account_id=663580750d0c0bce&drive_id=663580750d0c0bce&listtoken=b03290e8f4203fe6219ea68270f084bc), witch is the most detailed specification for topographic maps.

This project is heavily inspired by [karttapullautin](https://github.com/rphlo/karttapullautin/tree/master) and [Terje Mathisen's pipeline](https://tmsw.no/mapping/basemap_generation.html). Unlike them, it uses the [PDAL](https://pdal.io) and the [GDAL](https://gdal.org) libraries to preprocess the LiDAR data.

:::caution
Cassini is very early stage and still an experimental project. Use it at your own risks, expect API changes and bugs!
