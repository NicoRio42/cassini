## What is Cassini

Cassini is a software that generates highly accurate [topographic maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topographic_map) from <GlossaryLink slug="lidar" /> data and <GlossaryLink slug="shapefile" /> vector data. The maps produced by Cassini follow the <GlossaryLink slug="isom" label="International Specification for Orienteering Maps (ISOM)" />, witch is the most detailed specification for [topographic maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topographic_map).

This project is heavily inspired by <GlossaryLink slug="karttapullautin" /> and [Terje Mathisen's pipeline](https://tmsw.no/mapping/basemap_generation.html). Unlike them, it uses <GlossaryLink slug="pdal" /> (The Point Data Abstraction Library) and <GlossaryLink slug="gdal" /> (The Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) to preprocess the <GlossaryLink slug="lidar" /> data.

:::caution
Cassini is very early stage and still an experimental project. Use it at your own risks, expect API changes and bugs! Please [fill an issue on Github](https://github.com/NicoRio42/cassini/issues/new) if you find any bug.

:::note[Did you know?]
Cassini is (humbly) named after the [Cassini map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini_map), which is the first topographic and geometric map made of the Kingdom of France as a whole, by the Cassini family in the 1700's.

## Why does Cassini exist

Cassini is developped to be the main rendering engine for the [Mapant.fr](https://mapant.fr) project. The project goal is to generate the most precise topographic map of France out of freely available <GlossaryLink slug="lidar" /> data and <GlossaryLink slug="shapefile" /> data. It is inspired by its predecessors:

- [Mapant.fi](https://www.mapant.fi/) for Finland
- [Mapant.no](https://mapant.no/) for Norway
- [Gokartor](https://kartor.gokartor.se/) for Sweden
- [Mapant.es](https://mapant.es/) for Spain
- [Mapant.ch](https://www.mapant.ch/) for Switzerland
- [Mapant.orienteering.lu](https://mapant.orienteering.lu/) for Luxembourg

All of these projects somehow used [Jarkko Ryyppö](https://x.com/RouteGadget)'s [awsome Karttapullautin original Perl program](https://routegadget.net/karttapullautin/) to generate the map (at the exeption of [Mapant.ch](https://www.mapant.ch/) that used the <GlossaryLink slug="ocad" /> mapping software). Now that <GlossaryLink slug="karttapullautin" /> has been rewritten in <GlossaryLink slug="rust" /> by [Raphaël Stefanini](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rphlo/), the performances are better than ever.

However, there is some reasons that pushed me to develop my own rendering engine for [Mapant.fr](https://mapant.fr).

### The point cloud reading bottleneck

A <GlossaryLink slug="lidar" /> file is basically just a list of millions of 3 dimensions points (with some metadata). To process it, a program should at some point loop over all these points, witch is very time consuming. <GlossaryLink slug="karttapullautin" /> uses the popular [`las` Rust library](https://crates.io/crates/las) to do so. For some reason (that I ignore), this library performs worst than the <GlossaryLink slug="cpp" /> equivalent programs (<GlossaryLink slug="pdal" />, The Point Data Abstraction Library or <GlossaryLink slug="lastools" />).

### The edges artifacts problem

The surface area of France is 551,695 square kilometers. This means that there is 551,695 one kilometer large tiles to process to generate the [Mapant.fr](https://mapant.fr) map. This is way too much work for one computer, so it should be distributed on several machines.

To easily distribute the computing, a worker node should be able to render one tile after another independently. But this is easier said than done because of the edges artifacts problem.

![An exemple of a LiDAR generated map with artifacts on the edges](../../assets/artifacts.png)

On the right border of the <GlossaryLink slug="lidar" /> generated map above, you can see artifacts on <GlossaryLink slug="contours" /> and vegetation. There are artificially more [formlines](https://omapwiki.orienteering.sport/symbols/103-form-line/), and there is a thin vertical white band. This is because the <GlossaryLink slug="contours" /> and the vegetation generation algorithms need to know about the close neighborhood of a cell during computing, and this neighborhood is incomplete at the edges of a <GlossaryLink slug="lidar" /> file.

To remedy this problem, a classic approach is to add a buffer to every tiles:

- You download the 8 adjacent <GlossaryLink slug="lidar" /> tiles.
- You generate a new <GlossaryLink slug="lidar" /> tile with a 200 meters buffer all around it.
- You generate the map for this tile (for example with <GlossaryLink slug="karttapullautin" />).
- You crop the resulting image to the original tile extent

![A schema of a tile extent with a 200 metters buffer](../../assets/tile-with-buffer.png)

This way the artifacts are cropped away from the resulting image. This technique has the advantage of being simple. However, it is very inefficient. The problem is that:

- All the points of the 9 tiles (the targeted tile and the 8 adgacent ones) have to be read to create the buffered tile.
- Then, all the points from the buffered tile have to be read again during the map generation.

As mentioned in the previous paragraph, reading <GlossaryLink slug="lidar" /> points is very time consuming. It takes up a large part of the calculation time. With this approach, 10 times more points have to be read, compared to if you could just directly process the original tile without buffer.

### The Cassini approach

Cassini is designed to adress these two problems. To improve the point cloud reading speed, it simply uses the <GlossaryLink slug="pdal" /> library to read and preprocess the <GlossaryLink slug="lidar" /> data.

To solve the edges artifacts problem, it uses a much more efficient approach than the one described above. First, all <GlossaryLink slug="lidar" /> tiles are processed once with <GlossaryLink slug="pdal" />. During this step, the program produces temporary files that are not subject to the edges artifacts problem:

- A <GlossaryLink slug="dem" />, representing the terrain elevation
- A set of vegetation density <GlossaryLink slug="raster" label="rasters" /> (one for low vegetation, and one for high vegetation)

These <GlossaryLink slug="raster" label="rasters" /> are not subject to the edges artifacts problem because:

- The tile's extent area is clipped to one meter by one meter cells.
- A value is attributed to each of these cells depending only on the points that it contains.
- Thus the value does not depend on the neighborhood of the cell.

Then, a buffer is added to these raster, using the adgacent tiles <GlossaryLink slug="raster" label="rasters" /> just like in the approach described in the paragraph above. It is orders of magnitudes faster to add a buffer to a <GlossaryLink slug="raster" /> than to add a buffer to a <GlossaryLink slug="lidar" /> tile. Finally, the map is generated from these <GlossaryLink slug="raster" label="rasters" />. This approach guaranties that every <GlossaryLink slug="lidar" /> points are only read once.

### The tradeoffs

As mentioned, Cassini uses the <GlossaryLink slug="pdal" /> and the <GlossaryLink slug="gdal" /> libraries to process <GlossaryLink slug="lidar" /> and <GlossaryLink slug="raster" /> data. These libraries are very fast and efficient, but they are implemented in C++. As for now, their is no stable integration in the <GlossaryLink slug="rust" label="Rust programming language" /> for <GlossaryLink slug="pdal" /> and <GlossaryLink slug="gdal" />. Thus, they should be installed separately on the computer (using [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/)). This is much more complexe and less beginner friendly than <GlossaryLink slug="karttapullautin" /> for example, that is a standalone program with no external runtime dependencies.

## Alternatives to Cassini

### Karttapullautin

<GlossaryLink slug="karttapullautin" /> is the project that inspired Cassini. It
is an all-in-one tool to generate highly accurate [topographic maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topographic_map)
from <GlossaryLink slug="lidar" /> data and <GlossaryLink slug="shapefile" /> data.
It originally was implemented in <GlossaryLink slug="perl" /> by [Jarkko Ryyppö](https://x.com/RouteGadget),
but has recently been rewritten in <GlossaryLink slug="rust" /> by [Raphaël Stefanini](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rphlo/).
It is pretty simple to start with, with a lot of configuration and customisation
possibilities. It is however a <GlossaryLink slug="cli" /> (like Cassini), so it
requires using a terminal.

### Terje Mathisen's pipeline

In 2013, Terje Mathisen wrote [an article](https://tmsw.no/mapping/basemap_generation.html) about a pipeline he developed to generate maps from <GlossaryLink slug="lidar" /> data. Being an orienteering mapper, his main goal was to output a base map to help him during his mapping surveys. His pipeline uses the <GlossaryLink slug="lastools" /> library to preprocess the <GlossaryLink slug="lidar" /> files, the same way that Cassini uses PDAL to do so. <GlossaryLink slug="lastools" /> being a licenced software, it constraints the usage of this pipeline. However, the accompanying article is very interesting by explaining the process step by step.

### OCAD

The <GlossaryLink slug="ocad" /> mapping software supports map generation from <GlossaryLink slug="lidar" /> data in its latest versions. Unlike the previously mentioned tools, <GlossaryLink slug="ocad" /> is a desktop application with a <GlossaryLink slug="gui" /> (GUI). It makes it accessible to users with less knowledges of Computer Science and programming. However, <GlossaryLink slug="ocad" /> is a licenced software.
