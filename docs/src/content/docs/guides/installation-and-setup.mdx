This document will guide you to install Cassini and all its dependencies on your machine.

## Installing PDAL and GDAL

Cassini uses the [PDAL](https://pdal.io) and the [GDAL](https://gdal.org) libraries to process LiDAR and shapefiles data. To use Cassini, you first need to install them on your machine.

The easiest way to install PDAL and GDAL is with Miniconda. Bellow are some command line instructions reproduced from [Miniconda documentation](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/#quick-command-line-install) to quickly install miniconda:

<Tabs syncKey="os">
  <TabItem label="Windows" icon="seti:windows">
>    These three commands quickly and quietly install the latest 64-bit version of the installer and then clean up after themselves. To install a different version or architecture of Miniconda for Windows, change the name of the `.exe` installer in the `curl` command.
>
>    ```sh
>    curl https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86_64.exe -o miniconda.exe
>    start /wait "" miniconda.exe /S
>    del miniconda.exe
>    ```
>
>    After installing, open the “Anaconda Prompt (miniconda3)” program to use Miniconda3. For the Powershell version, use “Anaconda Powershell Prompt (miniconda3)”.
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem label="macOS" icon="apple">
>    These four commands quickly and quietly install the latest M1 macOS version of the installer and then clean up after themselves. To install a different version or architecture of Miniconda for macOS, change the name of the `.sh` installer in the `curl` command.
>
>    ```sh
>    mkdir -p ~/miniconda3
>    curl https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-arm64.sh -o ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
>    bash ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh -b -u -p ~/miniconda3
>    rm ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
>    ```
>
>    After installing, initialize your newly-installed Miniconda. The following commands initialize for bash and zsh shells:
>
>    ```sh
>    ~/miniconda3/bin/conda init bash
>    ~/miniconda3/bin/conda init zsh
>    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Linux" icon="linux">
>    These four commands quickly and quietly install the latest 64-bit version of the installer and then clean up after themselves. To install a different version or architecture of Miniconda for Linux, change the name of the `.sh` installer in the `wget` command.
> 
>    ```sh
>    mkdir -p ~/miniconda3
>    wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
>    bash ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh -b -u -p ~/miniconda3
>    rm ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
>    ```
>
>    After installing, initialize your newly-installed Miniconda. The following commands initialize for bash and zsh shells:
>
>    ```sh
>    ~/miniconda3/bin/conda init bash
>    ~/miniconda3/bin/conda init zsh
>    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


After following these instructions, the `conda` command should be available in you terminal. To check that everything worked:

```sh
conda --version
```

This should print the version of the conda program.

Then create a new miniconda environment named `cassini` with pdal and gdal installed:

```sh
conda create --yes --name cassini --channel conda-forge pdal gdal
```

Everytime you will open a new terminal and want to use Cassini, you will have to activate this environment:

```sh
conda activate cassini
```

## Downloading Cassini executable

Go to the [Latest release page on Github](https://github.com/NicoRio42/cassini/releases/latest). Then download the tar file corresponding to your operating system in the "Assets" section. Decompress it and copy the cassini executable where you want to use it on your machine.

If you want to make the `cassini` command globally available on you machine, you can follow [this tutorial](https://zwbetz.com/how-to-add-a-binary-to-your-path-on-macos-linux-windows/).
