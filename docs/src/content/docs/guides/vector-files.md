description: A guide to add vector data to your generated map with Cassini.

From LiDAR data, Cassini will only generate elevation contours, vegetation densities and cliffs. Human-related features (paths, roads, buildings...), and some water-related features (rivers, lakes...), should be generated from other data sources. Cassini can process these data from shapefiles files.

As for now, only [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)'s data are supported. Cassini will automatically download them during the map generation process.

In the future, Cassini will support other data sources via user defined configuration files.
