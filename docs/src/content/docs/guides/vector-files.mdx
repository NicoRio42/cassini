import GlossaryLink from "../../../components/GlossaryLink.astro";

From <GlossaryLink slug="lidar" /> data, Cassini will only generate elevation <GlossaryLink slug="contours" />, vegetation densities and cliffs. Human-related features (paths, roads, buildings...), and some water-related features (rivers, lakes...), should be generated from other data sources. Cassini can process these data from <GlossaryLink slug="shapefile" /> files.

As for now, only <GlossaryLink slug="osm" />'s data are supported. Cassini will automatically download them during the map generation process, so you don't have to download them manually yourself.

Only a small subset of <GlossaryLink slug="isom" /> symbols are supported now. Below is the list of supported symbols:

- [301 uncrossable body of water](https://omapwiki.orienteering.sport/symbols/301-uncrossable-body-of-water/)
- [304 crossable watercourse](https://omapwiki.orienteering.sport/symbols/304-crossable-watercourse/)
- [306 minor seasonal water channel](https://omapwiki.orienteering.sport/symbols/306-minor-seasonal-water-channel/)
- [308 marsh](https://omapwiki.orienteering.sport/symbols/308-marsh/)
- [502 wide road](https://omapwiki.orienteering.sport/symbols/502-wide-road/)
- [503 road](https://omapwiki.orienteering.sport/symbols/503-road/)
- [505 footpath](https://omapwiki.orienteering.sport/symbols/505-footpath/)
- [509 railway](https://omapwiki.orienteering.sport/symbols/509-railway/)
- [510 power line cableway or skilift](https://omapwiki.orienteering.sport/symbols/510-power-line-cableway-or-skilift/)
- [511 major power line](https://omapwiki.orienteering.sport/symbols/511-major-power-line/)
- [520 area that shall not be entered](https://omapwiki.orienteering.sport/symbols/520-area-that-shall-not-be-entered/)
- [521 building](https://omapwiki.orienteering.sport/symbols/521-building/)

[520 area that shall not be entered](https://omapwiki.orienteering.sport/symbols/520-area-that-shall-not-be-entered/) can be skipped with the `--skip-520` flag.

In the future, Cassini will support other data sources via user defined configuration files.
