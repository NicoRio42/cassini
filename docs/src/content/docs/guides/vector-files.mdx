import GlossaryLink from "../../../components/GlossaryLink.astro";

From <GlossaryLink slug="lidar" /> data, Cassini will only generate elevation <GlossaryLink slug="contours" />, vegetation densities and cliffs. Human-related features (paths, roads, buildings...), and some water-related features (rivers, lakes...), should be generated from other data sources. Cassini can process these data from <GlossaryLink slug="shapefile" /> files.

As for now, only <GlossaryLink slug="osm" />'s data are supported. Cassini will automatically download them during the map generation process, so you don't have to download them manually yourself.

Only a small subset of <GlossaryLink slug="isom" /> symbols are supported now. Below is the list of supported symbols:

- 308 marsh
- 301 uncrossable body of water
- 521 building
- 502 wide road
- 503 road
- 505 footpath
- 304 crossable watercourse

In the future, Cassini will support other data sources via user defined configuration files.
