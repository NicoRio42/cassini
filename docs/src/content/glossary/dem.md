A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is a 3D representation of a terrain's surface, created from elevation data collected at specific intervals. It is used in various applications like geographic information systems (GIS), modeling, and simulation to analyze and visualize topographic features. DEMs are essential for tasks such as flood risk assessment, landscape analysis, and infrastructure planning.
