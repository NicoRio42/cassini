C++ is a powerful, high-performance programming language widely used for system/software development, game programming, and real-time simulations. It extends the C language by adding object-oriented features, allowing developers to create complex applications with reusable code. Known for its efficiency and control over system resources, C++ is favored in industries where performance is critical. It remains a cornerstone language in computer science, offering both low-level memory manipulation and high-level abstractions.
