In computer science, a thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process, allowing tasks to run concurrently within the same program. Threads share the same memory space and resources of the process they belong to, enabling efficient multitasking and parallelism. They are commonly used to perform multiple operations simultaneously, improving the performance and responsiveness of applications.
