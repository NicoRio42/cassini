Perl is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its strengths in text processing and scripting. Often described as the "Swiss Army knife" of programming, Perl excels at handling regular expressions, file manipulation, and rapid prototyping. It is widely used in system administration, web development, and bioinformatics for its flexibility and powerful built-in features. Perl's motto, "There's more than one way to do it," reflects its adaptability and the creative freedom it offers developers.
