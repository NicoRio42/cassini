In geomatics, a raster is a grid-based data structure used to represent spatial information, where each cell or pixel holds a value corresponding to a specific geographic attribute, such as elevation, temperature, or land cover. Rasters are commonly used in remote sensing, satellite imagery, and geographic information systems (GIS) to store and analyze continuous data over a defined area. This format is ideal for modeling and processing spatial phenomena that vary smoothly across a landscape.
