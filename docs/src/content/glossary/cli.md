A Command-Line Interface (CLI) is a text-based interface used to interact with a computer's operating system or software by typing commands. It provides users with precise control over system functions, allowing for automation, script execution, and advanced configurations that might not be available through graphical interfaces. CLIs are favored by power users and developers for their efficiency and the ability to perform complex tasks quickly. Despite their minimalistic appearance, they offer a powerful way to manage and manipulate systems and applications.
