Miniconda is a minimal installer for Conda, an open-source package management system and environment management tool. It provides a lightweight version of the Anaconda distribution, containing only Conda and its dependencies, allowing users to install additional packages as needed. Miniconda is ideal for users who want to maintain a smaller footprint and greater control over their Python environments.
