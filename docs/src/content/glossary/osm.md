The OpenStreetMap project is a collaborative, open-source initiative that creates and provides free geographic data and mapping to anyone who wants to use it. Built and maintained by a global community of volunteers, it offers detailed and editable maps, which are used in various applications, from navigation to urban planning. OpenStreetMap emphasizes openness and accessibility, allowing users to contribute and access data freely.
